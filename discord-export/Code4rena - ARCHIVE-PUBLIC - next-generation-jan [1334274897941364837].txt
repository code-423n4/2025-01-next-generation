@Lhoussaineph2001 hello. Contract  has never been published on the mainnet. Hence never upgraded. Our goal is to insure the robustness of our code before going live.

[02/05/2025 23:09] mjx1465
I know it says "./contracts/.." in scope.txt, but I have to ask - there are no script or config files in audit scope, right?


[02/06/2025 06:46] rexy.eth.
I think it's internal, and called only at initialization.  So it's basically admin controlled.


[02/06/2025 06:52] t0r4n4d0
How can we add images in reports?


[02/06/2025 10:12] _arnavjindal
delete the sepolia and amoy from the config.js file


[02/06/2025 10:20] tadev0
There is an internal called at initialization and an external allowing to add more request types
But never mind not a big deal

[03/03/2025 18:28] onlycharttrade_46838
The team doesn't have enough time to provide any updates.☹️


[03/04/2025 11:29] cloudellie
It's not that we wouldn't love to provide updates, just that it's very difficult to predict timelines on judging (and triage/sponsor review too). Even the number of submissions is not a perfect predictor. The complexity of the code, volume of findings, nuance of discussions between judge and sponsor, all contribute to variability with timelines. 

And we don't want to disappoint wardens by promising a date, then e.g. having some new information reopen discussions, etc. 

The good news: this will get much more transparent to you all once we ship the change mentioned [here](https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810929015509483554/1346114280075952228).

I think it would be a great feature in C4 to show all the submissions after closing, just like sherlock, codehawks and cantina.

why this is restricted to SR only instead of all waderns?

The judge is working locally and is also in discussion with the sponsors. We should have an update later this week.

Why the judging is taking that long on this contest, there are some misalignments between the sponsors and the judge ?

1 month 7 days for a 500 nSloc contest?

We're planning to provide earlier visibility on submissions for all wardens (not just SR) soon: https://discord.com/channels/810916927919620096/810929015509483554/1346114280075952228. But PJQA will remain an SR privilege.


[03/17/2025 10:19] kyosi2963
Are escalations open during PJQA phase ?


[03/17/2025 10:21] cloudellie
Post-judging QA is what we call the process. Other platforms call it "escalations." There are different rules and processes on different platforms, but the overall concept is the same, i.e. to ensure the judging is thoroughly reviewed.

But my profile name is not reflected on the submission board....😫


[03/20/2025 12:48] cloudellie
That just means that your submissions were not judged to be satisfactory. You would need the SR role to view all submissions to the audit.


[03/20/2025 12:48] cloudellie
I know it's currently very difficult for wardens to see how the process works. We are expecting to ship some big improvements next week that will allow you to observe the validation, sponsor review, and judging processes, and see the evaluations and comments on your submissions. 

We beg your patience as we put the final touches on these features -- we're as eager as you are to address these concerns and ensure that hardworking wardens have access to this information.


[03/20/2025 12:54] caesar581

Question, now that the judging is over, were there practically valid issues invalidated due to mistakes in the project documentation? Is this a standard practice or rather a precedent?


[03/20/2025 15:27] maxel9890
Hey, super happy with the result! 🔥 , but also surprised. Submitted 3 issues, got only 1 accepted, still higher on LB than guys with more issues. First 2 places are 1 issue also with very high payout. Is that only because of duplicates number, or some other reason aswell?

[03/20/2025 15:41] thebrittfactor
It's up to the judge to determine validity/severity of documentation errors. I suggest waiting until the report is published to review the findings.


[03/20/2025 15:44] thebrittfactor
Correct, there were a fair amount of duplicates, which lessened that payout for a couple HM issues. More contributing factors on our award calculation can be reviewed [here](https://docs.code4rena.com/awarding/incentive-model-and-awards/awarding-process#awarding-process).
